# (Yet Another) Grid World !

### Introduction

This is a simple but highly customizable implementation of a Grid World in Python using Matplotlib and following the spirit of OpenAI Gym environments.


The grid can be generated by specifying:
- **`height`** - height of the gridworld
- **`width`** - width of the gridworld
- **`start`** - cell where agent will start after resetting or reaching goals
- **`goals`** - goal cells, once reached the episode will finish and agent return to start
- **`walls`** - wall cells, 
- **`cliffs`** - turn right.
- **`continuation_reward`** - turn right.
- **`cliff_reward`** - turn right.
- **`wall_reward`** - turn right.

It is also possible to construct a simple cliff gridworld (same as in OpenAI Gym) by setting `auto_grid=True`.

The environment, once instantiated, allow for the agent to navigate towards the grid by calling to the usual environment methods:

- `reset` - environment will be reset and agent will go to start position
- `step` - environment will take one single step acording to the action passed, and will return `next_state`, `reward` and `done`.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repo and install all the requirements 

2. Run the test script or the sample notebook to see a demonstration of different grids:


### Roadmap

Next versions are planning to include:

 - Plotting a learned value function over the grid
 - Noisy steps, controlled by a noise factor
 - Jump cells, both deterministic and random jumps
 - Doors to be open after collecting keys
 - Connected grids (in order to allow Hierarchical learning)
